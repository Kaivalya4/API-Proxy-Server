A Proxy Server to hide your api key . 

<h2>First Commit</h2>
<p>OpenWeather API call and Open Cage API call has been done in the above code</p>

<h1>Purpose and Use :pencil2:</h1>
<li>Donwload the template</li>
<li>Host it on the providers like RENDER</li>
<li>Store your API key in .env file</li>
<li>For each frontend application create a folder in routes and perform api calls from there and send data to frontend</li>
<li>Update your github repo</li>
<li>Once you connect your GitHub or GitLab account to your Render account, Render will automatically build and deploy your services with every push</li>
<li>Don't Forget to add Environment variable on Render as we are adding our .env file to .gitignore for safety </li>
<li>Great :smiley: !!! same deployed server can be used to store api keys and to perform api call</li>
